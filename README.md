# Wine-Quality-Prediction
Developed a Machine Learning model to classify white wine quality into Bad, Average, and Good categories using physicochemical features. Performed data preprocessing, label encoding, and train-test split, and trained a Logistic Regression model. Evaluated performance using a classification report, confusion matrix, and visualized the distribution.
